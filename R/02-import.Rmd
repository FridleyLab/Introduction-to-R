## Importing TCAG data 

Import both TCGA data files using either the "Import Dataset" GUI or by writing
commands. Then take a look at the data. 

## select()

Show the first 4 columns of the clinical data (hint there are multiple ways to do this)

## filter()

Filter clinical data to individuals who have kidney renal cell carcinoma (KIRC) 
and were diagnosed over the age of 60.

## summarize()

## mutate()

Create a new variable of the log of PTEN expression and call it pten_log

## arrange()

Order gene expression data by DNAH12 expression then DNAH10 expression

## piping

Piping allows you to combine steps - "and then" and avoids nesting functions or needing
to create new data frames for each manipulation 

## group_by()

Allows you to apply the "verbs" on the object "by group"

## case_when()

Replaces the traditional `ifelse()`
