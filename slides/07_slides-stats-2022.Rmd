# Pearson’s chi-squared test
 
The chi squared test is a non-parametric test that can be applied to contingency tables with various dimensions. The name of the test originates from the chi-squared distribution, which is the distribution for the squares of independent standard normal variables. This is the distribution of the test statistic of the chi squared test, which is defined by the sum of chi-square values for all cells arising from the difference between a cell’s observed value and the expected value, normalized by the expected value.
 
$\chi ^{2}$ = $\sum_{ij}$ $\frac{(O_{ij} - E_{ij})^{2}}{E_{ij}}$ 


*   $\chi ^{2}$ = chi square statistic
*   $O_{ij}$ = observed value
*   $E_{ij}$ = expected value


---
## Pearson’s chi-squared test
 
The null hypothesis of the Chi-Square test is that no relationship exists between the categorical variables in the population; they are independent.

 
```{r chisqtest, echo=FALSE ,  include=TRUE}
 tcga %>% 
  tabyl(smoking, gender, show_na = FALSE ) %>% 
  adorn_totals(where = c("row","col")) %>% 
  adorn_percentages(denominator = "col") %>% 
  adorn_pct_formatting(digits = 0)   %>% 
  adorn_ns(position = "front") 
 

 
```
 


---

## Pearson’s chi-squared test
 
The null hypothesis of the Chi-Square test is that no relationship exists between the categorical variables in the population; they are independent.

 

```{r chisqtest1, eval=TRUE,  include=TRUE}
 
tcga %>% tabyl( smoking, gender , show_na = FALSE ) %>%
  chisq.test()

```
 
The p-value is very low so we reject the null hypothesis that there is no association between the variables. 

---

## Pearson’s chi-squared test
 
  More women are never smokers and more men are current smokers.

# Fisher’s Exact test
 
Similar to Chi square test. Use the Fisher's exact test of independence when you have two nominal variables and you want to see whether the proportions of one variable are different depending on the value of the other variable. Use it when the sample size is small.


How the test works:

Unlike most statistical tests, Fisher's exact test does not use a mathematical function that estimates the probability of a value of a test statistic; instead, you calculate the probability of getting the observed data, and all data sets with more extreme deviations, under the null hypothesis that the proportions are the same. 


---

## Fisher’s Exact test
 

```{r fishers1, eval=TRUE,  include=TRUE}
tcga <- tcga  %>% mutate(Death = ifelse(vital_status == "Dead"," Yes","No"))

tcga %>% filter(race %in% c("ASIAN")) %>% 
  tabyl(gender, Death, show_na = TRUE) %>% 
  adorn_totals(where = c("row","col")) %>% 
  adorn_percentages(denominator = "row") %>% 
  adorn_pct_formatting(digits = 0) %>% 
  adorn_ns(position = "front") 

```

---

## Fisher’s Exact test
  
The null hypothesis is that the relative proportions of one variable are independent of the second variable. For 2 by 2 tables, the null of conditional independence is equivalent to the hypothesis that the odds ratio equals one. 


```{r fishers2, eval=TRUE,  include=TRUE}

tcga %>% filter(race %in% c("ASIAN")) %>% 
  tabyl(gender, Death, show_na = TRUE) %>% fisher.test() 


```

# Kaplan-Meier Curves and estimates
 
The Kaplan–Meier estimator,also known as the product limit estimator, is a non-parametric statistic used to estimate the survival function from time to event data. In medical research, it is often used to measure the fraction of patients living for a certain amount of time after treatment. In other fields, Kaplan–Meier estimators may be used to measure the time-to-failure of machine parts.


 
---

## Kaplan-Meier Curves and estimates
 
 

A plot of the Kaplan–Meier estimator is a series of declining horizontal steps which, with a large enough sample size, approaches the true survival function for that population. The value of the survival function between successive distinct sampled observations ("clicks") is assumed to be constant.

An important advantage of the Kaplan–Meier curve is that the method can take into account some types of censored data, particularly right-censoring, which occurs if a patient withdraws from a study, is lost to follow-up, or is alive without event occurrence at last follow-up. On the plot, small vertical tick-marks state individual patients whose survival times have been right-censored. When no truncation or censoring occurs, the Kaplan–Meier curve is the complement of the empirical distribution function.

---

## Kaplan-Meier Curves and estimates
 
The estimator of the survival function: 
 
$\hat{S}(t)$ = $\prod_{i:t_{i}<t}$ $(1-\frac{d_{i}}{n_{i}})$ 

*   $\hat{S}(t)$ = probability survival is longer than $t$ 
*   $d_{i}$ = number of deaths (events) that happened at time $t_{i}$ 
*   $n_{i}$ = number of individuals that have survived to time $t_{i}$

# Log rank test
  
The log rank test is a hypothesis test to compare the survival distributions of two or more samples. It is a nonparametric test and appropriate to use when the data are right skewed and censored. It is widely used in clinical trials to establish the efficacy of a new treatment in comparison with a control treatment when the measurement is the time to event (such as the time from initial treatment to a heart attack). The test is sometimes called the Mantel–Cox test, named after Nathan Mantel and David Cox. The logrank test can also be viewed as a time-stratified Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test.
