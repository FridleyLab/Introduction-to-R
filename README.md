## Overview

This is a six week course designed to introduce future users to R and Rstudio.
We will cover data cleaning using the `tidyverse`, creating visuals with `ggplot`,
basic statistical analysis and writing documents with `Rmarkdown`. In the end 
you should be able to: 

<!--
Each instructor should provide a one sentence summary of what participants
will be able to do after thier lecture 
-->

  - import and manipulate data into different formats
  - create new variables and recode existing ones
  - plot data using the appropriate figure type
  - perform basic statistics
  - write Rmarkdown reports

## Who is this course designed for?

Have you never written any code in R or any other programming language?
Are you familiar with R, but hoping to bulk up your basic skills? Have
you used R but are new to the `tidyverse` framework?

  - Explain the fundamentals of "tidy data" and the `tidyverse`
  - Clean data sets using `dplyr` verbs
    
Data manipulation and cleaning - Part II

  - Merge data sets
  - Transform data  
    
Visualization 

  - Understand the principles of `ggplot2`
  - Determine appropriate visualizations 
  - Plot - `geom_smooth` to see a model over the data 
    
Basic statistics 

  - ttest, correlation and chisq 
  - Model data 
  - Report findings from R output 
    
Final coding project 

  - Organize projects and name objects in a uniform manner
  - Create a reproducible workflow
  - Setting up your own R installation 

## Materials/RStudio Cloud

Materials will be made available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/FridleyLab/Introduction-to-R/). If you are
using an organization-issued laptop, you may want to verify before you
arrive that you can access GitHub. 

In this course, we will be using a version of RStudio available online. The class
workspace can be accessed [here](https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/146648/join?access_code=lwgMkLa2E%2BSSKGUFRhilRqgJW1lz7OCF9pZVjhxf). Please create a user account before the first day of class 
(or connect with either a GitHub account or Google account).
