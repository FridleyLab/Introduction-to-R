## Overview

This is a six week course designed to introduce future users to R and Rstudio.
We will cover data cleaning using the `tidyverse`, creating visuals with `ggplot`,
basic statistical analysis and writing documents with `Rmarkdown`. In the end 
you should be able to: 

<!--
Each instructor should provide a one sentence summary of what participants
will be able to do after thier lecture 
-->

  - import and manipulate data into different formats
  - create new variables and recode existing ones
  - plot data using the appropriate figure type
  - perform basic statistics
  - write Rmarkdown reports

## Who is this course designed for?
