```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Formatted text:

-   *italics*
-   **bold**
-   `code`
-   [links](https://www.tidyverse.org/)

```{r}
# example code chunk 

x <- seq(0,10,2)
x
```

Sequential lines will be
rendered as
a
 single line.
 
### Activity 1

Write a few sentences introducing yourself and add a picture of your favorite
animal below.

Then re-render your document. 

My name is Jordan and I work in Health Informatics at Moffitt Cancer Center!

![](01-rmarkdown-image.jpeg){width=50%}

<!-- Text inside of [] is a caption -->
<!-- If you are outputting to a PDF and using an image hosted on the web than you will  -->
<!-- most likely get an error. That is because when rmarkdown creates a PDF it uses latex -->
<!-- which doesnt like images in this format (only local images). So you should download  -->
<!-- the image locally and then use the image. Example R code for downloading a local image is shown below! -->

```{r results = 'asis', out.width="40px"}
download.file(
  url = "http://www.online-image-editor.com//styles/2014/images/example_image.png",
  destfile = "image.png",
  mode = 'wb')
knitr::include_graphics(path = "image.png")
```

### Activity 2

Add a parameter to this report changing a few elements in the sentences you
wrote for activity one. This should make it so that you just need to 
change parameters (hint found in YAML) in order to create a new introduction
paragraph. 

My name is ``r params$employee_name`` and I work in 
``r params$employee_department`` at Moffitt Cancer Center!

<!-- You can change the parameters in the output by clicking the arrow beside  -->
<!-- Knit at the top and select "Knit with parameters" and enter the parameter -->
<!-- values and then select knit  -->

<!-- render("01-rmarkdown.Rmd", params = list(employee_name = "Brooke")) -->

### Activity 3

The area of a circle is equal to $\pi r^{2}$. Write a code chunk that calculates
the area of circles with radi of 748, 35, and 2.986, and write a summary sentence,
with the answers included. 

```{r}

radius <- c(748, 35, 2.986)

areas <- pi * radius^2

```

The rounded areas of these circles are `r round(areas)`

### Activity 4

Change the output this document to output a PDF document and word document.
